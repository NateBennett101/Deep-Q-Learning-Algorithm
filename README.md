# Deep-Q-Learning-Algorithm

This project is a treasure hunting game that is played by an agent with an integrated deep q-learning algorithm, where the objective is to navigate a maze and get the treasure.
For this project I was given starter code that contained things like the imports, a maze object, a show function, an action's directory, a play game, completion check, and build modal functions, and more. What the code did not have was a completed deep q-training algorithm.
I implemented this algorithm to train itself over various episodes, utilizing rewards and penalties with weights, in this case the rewards or penalties were how close the agent was to getting the treasure, and penalties were if the agent was moving farther away from the treasure.
The agent is then updated, becoming better as the training progresses, until the agent reaches a one hundred percent win rate.

Computer scientists can develop software to solve real world problems. The field of computer science could span almost every industry, and this work matters as software can automate and improve many things, from machinery to online applications, increasing efficiency, and revenue.
Approaching a problem as a computer scientist can involve understanding the problem, breaking the problem down into smaller components, develop a step-by-step plan, start development, then test and release the solution.
Ethical responsibilities for the end user and the organization can include being transparent about data utilization, and trying to follow best practices throughout development.
